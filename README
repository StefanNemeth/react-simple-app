# react-simple-app

The repository I use for creating new React.js apps (simple ones - no Redux or router stuff).

### How to use?
It requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run. Download and extract the [code base](https://github.com/SteveWinfield/react-simple-app/archive/master.zip).

Install the dependencies and start the server:

```sh
$ cd react-simple-app
$ npm install
$ npm run dev-server
```

### Features

* Babel installed using "es2015" and "react" presets
* Webpack configured to use Babel, react-hot-loader and es-lint
* es-lint extending [Airbnb JavaScript guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) rules
* Using [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) as "bootstrap implementation"
